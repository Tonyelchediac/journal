  "title": "Batroun: A Coastal Gem with Modern Challenges and Rich Heritage",
  "summary": "Batroun today balances on a delicate axis: thriving as a staycation haven and economic lifeline, yet also vulnerable to environmental risks and caught in regional geopolitical tensions. Its blend of ancient charm and modern vibrancy continues to attract both locals and visitors—an uplifting counter-narrative amid Lebanon’s broader challenges",
  "content": "1. Thriving Local Tourism\n\nDespite Lebanon's ongoing economic hardships and pandemic-related travel restrictions, Batroun has emerged as a vibrant domestic tourist destination. With Lebanese citizens unable to travel abroad due to the crisis and pandemic, they’ve turned to coastal towns like Batroun. Streets are bustling with visitors strolling through ancient souks, relaxing on beaches, and enjoying the nightlife. Local guides such as John Bechara highlight the city’s historic churches, Phoenician sea wall, and old harbor — all reflecting decades of municipal tourism development  .\n\nA 54-year-old restaurant owner, Maguy al-Mouhawas, says:\n\n> “Lebanese can’t go for tourism abroad anymore… Batroun embraces them and their children… that’s why there’s a bigger turnout”.\n\nThe municipal head, Marcelino al‑Hark, notes this resurgence is the result of 22 years of consistent investment in hospitality and infrastructure  . While parking and traffic congestion have emerged as challenges, the economic boost to local businesses has been widely appreciated.\n\n2. Environmental Concerns: Forest Fires\n\nOn August 5, 2024, a significant fire broke out in the forests surrounding Batroun—specifically between Shabtin, Mrah al-Hajj, and Alali. Using windy conditions, the blaze consumed orchards and forest areas, posing a threat to nearby homes. Lebanese civil defense teams and army units stepped in to extinguish the flames and began cooling operations. Relief came after a coordinated effort, preventing wider devastation.\n\n3. Security Incident: Israeli Raid\n\nIn a startling development on November 2, 2024, Israeli elite naval commandos (unit Shayetet 13) conducted a covert amphibious raid in Batroun, abducting a Lebanese man identified by Israel as Imad Amhaz, whom they allege was a senior Hezbollah operative linked to naval operations. The raid targeted a chalet, and the individual was taken by speedboat to Israel for interrogation  .\n\nLebanese officials, including Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Transport Minister Ali Hamieh, criticized the operation. They labeled the abducted man “a civilian ship captain” taking courses at the Maritime Sciences and Technology Institute in Batroun and prepared to file a complaint with the UN Security Council, citing a potential violation of UN Resolution 1701.\n\n4. Heritage Highlights\n\nOne of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited cities — Batroun, formerly known as Botrys, has roots stretching back to the Bronze Age  .\nHistoric landmarks & UNESCO recognition: Pilgrims and tourists are drawn to its Phoenician sea wall, Makaad El Mir, St. Stephen’s Cathedral, and traditional souk. Its historic center is listed on UNESCO’s Tentative List for World Heritage  .",

  "title": "Qlayaat Airport: Lebanon’s Long-Awaited Second Gateway Nears Revival",
  "summary": "Qlayaat Airport (René Mouawad Air Base) in northern Lebanon is being revived as the country’s second international airport. Originally a military base, it’s now set for civilian and cargo use by 2026. The project promises economic growth for the Akkar region, though it faces funding and political challenges. Government and private investors are collaborating to bring the vision to life",
  "content": "QOBAYAT, After decades of dormancy, Lebanon is edging closer to opening its long-overlooked northern airfield — the Qlayaat Airport, officially known as René Mouawad Air Base. Once a strategic military facility, the site is being reimagined as a fully operational civilian and cargo airport, signaling a new era of regional development and transportation equity for the north.\nSituated just 7 kilometers from the Syrian border and roughly 26 kilometers from Tripoli, the air base was initially built by the Iraq Petroleum Company in 1934 and later operated by the French military. In 1966, the Lebanese Army assumed control, converting it into a modern air base. For a brief period between 1988 and 1990, Middle East Airlines (MEA) operated domestic flights there — until the airport once again fell silent.\nBut momentum has returned in 2025.\nA Strategic Vision from the North\nEarlier this year, Public Works and Transport Minister Fayez Rasamny described Qlayaat as a \"strategic asset\" that could serve as Lebanon’s much-needed second commercial airport. The master plan — spearheaded by Dar Al-Handasah engineering consultants — includes rehabilitating the 3,000-meter-long runway, constructing a civilian terminal, upgrading road access, and installing air traffic control and customs infrastructure.\n“This project will connect northern Lebanon to the world and support tourism, trade, and jobs,” Rasamny told reporters during a site visit in March. “It is not merely an airport; it is an economic engine.”\nEconomic Promise Amid Challenges\nAccording to government estimates, the full rehabilitation could cost upwards of $200 million. A Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model is being considered to attract Arab and international investment. The airport is expected to create over 2,000 jobs during the construction and early operation phases.\nParliamentarian Sajih Attieh, a vocal advocate for the project, said in a recent interview with LBCI, “We expect Qlayaat Airport to receive its first commercial flights by late 2025, with infrastructure work already in the early phases.”\nHowever, not everyone is convinced. Critics cite the lack of existing civilian infrastructure, proximity to conflict zones in Syria, and the risk of political disagreements stalling progress.\nInfrastructure at a Glance\nRunway: 3,000 meters, suitable for Boeing 737, Airbus A321, and widebody aircraft.\nCurrent Facilities: Military use only; no public terminal or customs.\nPlanned Additions: Civil terminal, security screening, cargo facilities, fire & rescue units, and access roads.\nSources close to the Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR) said feasibility and environmental studies are ongoing, and a formal tender is expected by Q3 of this year.\nPublic Reaction: Hope and Hesitation\nIn northern communities like Qobayat and Halba, residents express cautious optimism. “This airport will save us the three-hour trip to Beirut,” said Issam Daher, a school teacher from Akkar. “But we’ve heard promises before. We want action, not speeches.”\n\nOnline debates echo similar sentiments. Some Reddit users in the r/Lebanon forum praised the government’s revived interest, while others warned against politicizing the airport or underestimating its costs.",

      "summary": "In 2025, Lebanese-American relations are undergoing a major transformation. The U.S. is deeply involved in Lebanon’s political, security, and economic affairs, aiming to curb Hezbollah’s influence, support institutional reform, and ensure regional stability. Despite shared interests in economic recovery and counterterrorism, tensions remain over Lebanon’s internal divisions, particularly concerning Hezbollah’s role in government. Meanwhile, new opportunities are emerging in digital infrastructure and military cooperation",
      "content": "1. Political Pressures and Hezbollah’s Disarmament\n\nIn June 2025, the United States delivered a six-page proposal to the Lebanese government outlining a path for Hezbollah to gradually disarm in exchange for Israeli troop withdrawals from southern Lebanon. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein has played a critical role in pushing for a ceasefire framework and a demilitarized zone under the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and UNIFIL.\n\nDeputy envoy Morgan Ortagus emphasized during her April 2025 visit to Beirut that U.S. assistance would be conditional on Hezbollah’s exclusion from the Lebanese government and a broader commitment to reforms. The U.S. considers Hezbollah a terrorist organization, and any normalization of aid hinges on curbing its political and military reach.\n\n2. Strengthening the Lebanese Armed Forces\n\nTo enhance Lebanese sovereignty and limit militia power, the U.S. redirected over $100 million in military aid in early 2025 to support the Lebanese Armed Forces. Major General Michael Leeney of U.S. Army Central has been deployed to Beirut to oversee coordination with the LAF and ensure ceasefire compliance.\n\nThe Pentagon's strategy includes training, logistics, and intelligence support aimed at empowering the LAF as Lebanon’s sole legitimate defense force.\n\n3. Economic Ties and Reform Demands\n\nThe United States continues to support Lebanon’s economic recovery through the IMF and World Bank. In April 2025, Lebanon secured a $250 million loan from the World Bank to support reforms in the energy sector. However, U.S. diplomats have insisted that additional aid is conditional on anti-corruption initiatives and financial transparency—especially in the central banking system.\n\nThe U.S. is closely monitoring the appointment of the next central bank governor, stressing the need for a technocrat independent of Hezbollah’s influence.\n\n4. Technology and Connectivity: The Starlink Initiative\n\nIn a notable development, Elon Musk contacted Lebanese President Joseph Aoun in June 2025 to propose licensing Starlink satellite internet services in Lebanon. The plan is supported by U.S. diplomats who see digital infrastructure as a vital component of national resilience.\n\nMusk’s initiative could provide affordable and fast internet access across Lebanon—especially in remote areas—reducing dependency on outdated telecom networks.\n\n5. Internal Divisions and U.S. Frustration\n\nDespite U.S. warnings, Hezbollah-affiliated ministers remain in the newly formed Lebanese government under Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, who assumed office in February 2025. The United States has expressed concern that Hezbollah’s involvement could derail reform efforts and prevent a full normalization of ties.\n\nAt the same time, Lebanese officials argue that Hezbollah represents a significant domestic constituency and cannot be excluded without risking internal instability.\n\n6. Regional Security and U.S. Mediation\n\nFollowing months of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, Washington is mediating to avoid full-scale war. The U.S. is pushing for a sustainable ceasefire, positioning itself as a guarantor of peace along Lebanon’s southern border. This effort includes pressuring Israel to halt airstrikes and persuading Hezbollah to reduce its military footprint.\n\nSome U.S. diplomats have even floated the idea of a broader normalization deal between Lebanon, Syria, and Israel—contingent on full demilitarization.\n\n7. Outlook: A Delicate Balance\n\nThe U.S.-Lebanon relationship in 2025 is both fragile and strategic. Washington sees Lebanon as a frontline state in the battle against Iranian influence and regional extremism. While mutual interests in reform, security, and technology cooperation exist, the presence of Hezbollah in government remains the primary obstacle.\n\nIf Lebanon can make tangible progress on reforms, disarmament, and institutional independence, U.S. investment and partnerships could rapidly expand. However, failure to act may lead to sanctions, aid freezes, and deeper isolation.",
